# Search

[![](search.png)](https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Search/example.html){target="_parent"}

This is a custom search engine I built to look at BNF Interaction, Radiopaedia, Dermnet, Emedicine, NICE, Child BNF, Evidence NHS, Nice Pathways, SIGN, CKS, and the BNF.<br>
These are all fantastic resources, and the only reason I've brought them together like this is so that I could toggle between the results, without searching on each of the websites individually.

I tend to use it to research for portfolio cases.

# BNF Interactions

[![](bnfinteraction.png)](https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/d3-2/){target="_parent"}

[![](bnfcustom.png)](https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/d3-dynamicclassed/){target="_parent"}

This is a tool I built to visualise BNF Interactions. You can view the top 100 most commonly prescribed drugs.

Or create your own selection from any BNF-listed drugs.

# Top 50 Drugs

This is a tool originally built by University of Glasgow students as an SSC project. <br>
It gives revision information on 50 common drug classes. <br>
I've since built a new beta version, [here.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/50 Drugs/){target="_parent"}

[![](50drugs.png)](https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/50 Drugs/){target="_parent"}

I've also exported the data as a .csv, and loaded it into Anki, a popular flashcard app.<br>
You can download the flashcards [here.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1385997073){target="_parent"}

# FOAMed

*FOAM – Free Open Access Meducation – Medical education for anyone, anywhere, anytime.*

*FOAM is a collection of resources, a community and an ethos. The FOAM community spontaneously emerged from the collection of constantly evolving, collaborative and interactive open access medical education resources being distributed on the web with one objective — to make the world a better place. FOAM is independent of platform or media — it includes blogs, podcasts, tweets, Google hangouts, online videos, text documents, photographs, facebook groups, and a whole lot more.*
